					<span class="myself">This is Mark and welcome to my profile page. 
					I am about to share you things about me to further introduce myself.
					I am a Computer Engineering student studying in Polytechnic University of the Philippines.
					I live in South Caloocan and from there I travel around an hour and a half to get to school. 
					Aside from studies, I also play the guitar. We often join in an amateur band competition in our school and wins most of the time.
					I also play games. Who doesn't? Sometimes this is what takes most of my time. 
					But, I realized that I need to manage my time more wisely now. 
					There are lots of things I need to learn to be able to be competitive in the field I will be working on.
					This may be the point in my life where we worry to much about our future and career path. 
					Enough about drama now. I was kind of drifted away. I would want to be wed developer. That is only one of the career paths I want to take.
					I also want to be a Network Engineer. Well, this is not gonna happen overnight but this starts now. 
					And then whenever I have time I want to use it on travel. I want to discover more of the world. 
					I will only live once and I at least want to experience being in different places in different countries before time takes me. 
					In fact, if I will be given the chance to be one of the people that NASA would send to other planet for experimental purposes then I will be happy to be part of it provided that I am already old and retired and about to die any sooner. Alright! I guess that is enough about me for now. See you around. Bye for now!
